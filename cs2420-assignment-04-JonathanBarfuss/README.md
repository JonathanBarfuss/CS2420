# Assignment 4
Create a  dynamic array based on doubly linked list.

The assignment had the following description:
"Using a doubly-linked list, write a template class named LinkedArray with an interface inspired by the JavaScript Array class. This class allows you to add one or more nodes to the end of the array using the push() functions or at the beginning using the unshift() functions. It also allows you to remove the last node using the pop() function or the first node using the shift() function."

All of the code in "include/linked_array.h" and "src/main.cpp" is my own work.
