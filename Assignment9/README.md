Assignment 09

In the "include/bst.h" file I implemented the height, level, minimum, maximum, toSortedArray, and search functions (The professor implemented the rest of the class for us). In the same program I implemented the showTree function.
In the main function I applied this sort to the alphabet, in such a way that the tree had a height of 5.
