# Assignment 05
Solve actual problems using the stack and queue data structures.

For this assignment all of my work was in the "include/util_functions.h" and "src/main.cpp" The purpose of this assignment was to create four functions to solve problems using stacks and queues. The four functions were:

1) A function to add 2 numbers as strings and return the answer as a string.

2) A function to determine if a string is a palindrome or not

3) A function to determing if a string containing a math function has as many open parenthesis/brackets/carrot/etc as closed ones.

4) A function to be able to solve a string containing a postfix expression
