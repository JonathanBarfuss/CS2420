Assignment 08

The assignment provided the following description:
"One of the most popular applications of heapsort is to efficiently implement a priority queue. A priority queue is a data structure that associates a priority value with every element in the queue, and depending on whether it is a maximum-first or a minimum-first queue, the element with maximum priority or minimum priority is extracted first.

In this assignment, you are asked to write and test a template class named PriorityQueue that implements an array-based priority queue based on heapsort. Every element in this queue is an instance of a given template Cell structure with two data members:  info and priority. By default, your class should be a maximum-first priority queue, but your implementation must support minimum-first queues as well. This class must be implemented inside the include/priority_queue.h header file.

In the src/main.cpp file, write a program that uses this class to enqueue at least of your favorite movies. Give each movie a rating between 1 and 10, with 10 being the most liked and 1 the least. The movies are added to the queue in no particular order."
