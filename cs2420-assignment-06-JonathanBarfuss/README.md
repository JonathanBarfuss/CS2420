#Assignment 6

The purpose of this assignment was to help us compare different implementations of a hash table. All of my work was in "include/hash_functions.h", "include/quadratic_hashtable.h", and "src/main.cpp". My job was to implement the quadratic hashtable myself (the professor provided linear and chained) and then develop three new hash functions (in the hash_functions.h file) to test in each of the hash tables.
