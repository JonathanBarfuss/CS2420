# Assignment 1
A template Range class.

The assignment provided the following description:
"A range is represented by three numbers: start, end, and step. It represents the list of values between ​start​ and ​end. Step, which defaults to 1, is the difference between any value in the range and the one next to it.
Depending on the value of ​step​, the value of end​ may or may not be in the list of values represented by the range. For example, a range between 2 and 7 and with a step of 1 has the values ​2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7​. Similarly, a range between 2 and 7 and with a step of 2 has the values: ​2, 4, 6​."

The assignment was to create a template class named Range and program it as described above.
All of my work is in the files "include/range.h" and "src/main.cpp".
