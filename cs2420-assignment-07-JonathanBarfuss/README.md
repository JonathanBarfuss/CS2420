Assignment 7

The assignment provided the following description:

"In this assignment, you are given two template classes: the dynamic array Bag<> and the doubly linked  List<>. The bubble, selection, and insertion sort algorithms have already been implemented for the Bag<> class. Your task is to implement these three algorithms for the List<> class. Your algorithms should support ascending and descending sorting.

In the src/main.cpp file, write a program that uses randomly generated (using the <random> header file) alphabet characters (lowercase or uppercase but not both) to test these algorithms. At a minimum, your testing should include sorting randomly ordered characters, sorting already sorted characters, and sorting reverse-ordered characters."
